# Ethernet2
* This is a fork of the Adafruit [Ethernet 2 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Ethernet2)
* This library supports the [WIZ85io module] http://www.wiznet.co.kr/product-item/wiz850io/) and W5500 chip

This Arduino library is for shields that use the **Wiznet [W5500]** chipset only.
It does **not** work with other chipsets, such as the original Arduino Ethernet shield which
uses the Wiznet [W5100] chipset.

For some documentation on the functions in this library, see 
http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Ethernet
but note that this is **note** the Arduino Ethernet library. It just supports many of the same functions.

## Example Programs
Lots of examples using this library, many tested 24/7 for months (as of 2017 Sep), with some documentation and an attempt at useful comments in the code

## W5500 Shields

* [Arduino Ethernet Shield v2](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShieldV2)

* [Wiznet W5500 Ethernet Shield](http://www.wiznet.co.kr/product-item/w5500-ethernet-shield/)
